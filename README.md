# EV_Load_Disaggregation
# Overview
The problem of disaggregating BTM EV load traces from smart meter data traces is studied. Based on the characteristics of typical EV charging traces, three interdependent sub-problems are formulated: a) Detecting the presence of BTM EVs, b) Estimating the EV charging rate, and c) Detecting the EV charging periods. A unified iterative algorithmic framework is developed to solve all three sub-problems. Importantly, the proposed algorithms do not assume or utilize the knowledge of ground truth EV load traces but estimate BTM EV load traces in an ``unsupervised'' fashion. Numerical evaluation is conducted based on real-world 15-minute interval smart meter data collected from Austin, TX, and demonstrates great performance achieved by the proposed algorithms.
